## Features

- Support for multiple draft types:
  - Grid draft (NEW!)
  - Booster draft
  - Sealed deck
- Cube draft
- Dual-pane interface for drafting and building a deck
- Zoom, sort, and categorize as you draft and build
- Send deck to deckstats.net for analysis, sample draws, etc.
- Save drafted decks in standard .dec format
- Fairness enforcement:
  - Client/server architecture; server maintains the state of drafts and players, clients receive only the information they are allowed to know
